# This is an official example of ZeroConfig syntax and more.
# Define something by using %variableName %variableValue

myConfigVar I love ZeroConfig!

# You can set int/float or boolean value, and it would be interpreted in Python as these classes.
intConfigVar 560
floatConfigVar 655.003
booleanConfigVar false

# You can use nested dictionaries like that
nest {
    message Hello, world!
    more_nests {
        message This is the second nest!
    }
}

# You can use multi-line strings
# IT'S IMPORTANT TO NOT USE THEM LIKE THAT:
# multiline_string """some value
# yay
# """

multiline_string """
Wow!
This is truly multiline!
"""

# I wish you good luck with ZeroConfig and your projects! ðŸ‘‹
